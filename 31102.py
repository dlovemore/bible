# 1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
# 2 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
# 3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
# 4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
# 5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
# 6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
# 7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
# 8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
# 9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
# 10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
# 11 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
# 12 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
# 13 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
# 14 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,
# 15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
# 16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;
# 17 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
# 18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
# 19 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
# 20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
# 21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
# 22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
# 23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
# 24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
# 25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
# 26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
# 27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
# 28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
# 29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
# 30 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
